Technical interviews can be a daunting experience especially if it's your first time. Well even if it's not your first time, they can be very different to how you code day to day. After being on both sides of the interview process. I wanted to share seven pieces of advice for someone doing a technical interview for the first time. These tips are what I've seen from strong candidates as an interviewer. And also what I've followed as an interviewee in the past. At the end of this post, I've added a note on how I practice for coding challenges. Without further ado, tip #1.

## 1. Clarify the problem

After I hear the problem, I'll repeat back what the interviewer is asking me to do. From there, I'll ask questions to clarify the scenario. These questions help me understand definitions and constraints (scale, use cases, etc). Don't go overboard! You don't want to get too in the weeds. Aim to get to a place where you're able to make an informed first step.

## 2. Talk through your solution

As I start to think about my solution I'll verbalize what's going through my head. I find that talking through my thought process clues the interviewer into how I think. While this strategy works for me, I know that it can be hard to think and talk at the same time. It's totally fine to let the interviewer know you're pausing to think. Either way you never want to leave the interviewer in the dark wondering what the candidate is thinking.

## 3. Be prepared to talk about tradeoffs

Know the limitations and the benefits of the tools and technology you use everyday. Generally speaking, questions about tradeoffs revolve around situations. Why would you use this piece of technology? How does it scale? How would you mitigate failure? Why is framework x better than y or why use a framework at all? The answers to these questions require context about the situation.

When talking about tradeoffs try to stay away from "stake in the ground" claims without evidence. In other words, don't be overly opinionated about the tools you choose. Every tool will have its place. One way to learn about tradeoffs is to build side projects. Side projects give you concrete examples of how a technology works in certain situations. They let you explore tradeoffs hands on.

## 4. Take things step by step

I will always write out a plan for a solution, either on paper or as comments in the code. Cluing the interviewer into your plan is part of talking through the solution. But now you need to execute the plan. At this point, I try not to skip around the plan. Unfortunately, more often than not, your initial plan will change as you start working on a problem. If you need to deviate, communicate why with the interviewer. As an interviewer, it's hard to keep track of a candidate's thought process if they're constantly jumping around a solution.

## 5. Take a breath and slow down

If I get _really_ stuck on a problem my brain stops working. I start to panic as I'm wasting time. And this panic causes me to not think clearly. And so starts the downward spiral. When I realize I'm stuck, I try to take a deep breath and slow down. Getting into a calmer state of mind helps me think through the problem. If need time to calm down, I'll let the interviewer know that I'm thinking about the problem and need a minute.

## 6. Don't be afraid to ask for help

If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask questions. Try to be as specific as possible. Once you get an answer to a question, take your time to process it. Try and figure out the next step on your own. It's sometimes hard to process the answer to the question if you're in panic mode. If you're panicking revisit tip #5 and slow down.

## 7. Interview the interviewer!

Interviewing is a 2 way streak. Be sure to note how the interviewer interacts with you. Ask them questions about their experience at the company. Are they someone you could see yourself pairing with daily? Are they someone you could learn from and grow as a developer? Do you have a good idea of how the engineering team works? Your goals and needs are not less than the company. Make sure the company is a good fit for you.

Interviewing is stressful, and it takes practice to get good at. One way to improve is to do a lot of interviews. That is easier said than done though. So I also practice with timed coding challenges. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are popular sites. I also like [Code Signal](https://codesignal.com/developers/) which has a nice code path for challenges. I'll also treat these coding problems like a real interview scenario where I talk through my problem. There's also Youtube videos of mock interviews or of how other devs break down coding challenges. Some of my favorites are by [interviewing.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLVi2y2GrY) and [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBuHSRDGZBY).

Technical interviews are far from perfect. It can be hard to judge someone's ability through a 1 hour coding problem. Hopefully, armed with these tips and resources you should be well equipped for your interview. If you have found these tips useful, it would be awesome if you shared it with a friend.

# Jono's Eleventy Blog
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/50c7c2ce-c15f-4e49-b6ad-7439a3a5f723/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kind-hodgkin-e00385/deploys)

Refresh of my website in 2020.

## Features
- Sass support

## Deploy
This site is deployed to Netlify. Running the npm build task generates a `dist` folder. This is the published folder to Netlify (see `netlify.toml`).

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Run locally
```bash
# This will start both eleventy and the sass compiler
npm run start
```

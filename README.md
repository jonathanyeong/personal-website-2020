# Jono's Eleventy Blog
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d6e74da5-c5f3-480b-8ae7-c7706679401c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elastic-engelbart-26e6d9/deploys)

Refresh of my website in 2020.

## Features
- Sass support

## Deploy
This site is deployed to Netlify. Running the npm build task generates a `dist` folder. This is the published folder to Netlify (see `netlify.toml`).

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Run locally
```bash
# This will start both eleventy and the sass compiler
npm run start
```
